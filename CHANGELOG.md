## [1.1.4] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **1.1.3's provenance fix did not reach any plugin that was already
  installed.** It recorded the source correctly, and the badge still read
  "Manual".

  `reconcile()` evaluated provenance at exactly two moments: the first time
  a file was seen, and whenever its checksum changed. An installation
  already tracked as unattributed therefore kept that label forever, even
  once `plugin_artifacts` gained a row naming its source. That covers every
  plugin installed before upgrading to 1.1.3, and every re-install of an
  identical version — same bytes in, checksum unchanged, so the "changed"
  branch never ran.

  Reconciliation now also adopts a source for an unchanged file when one
  becomes known for exactly those bytes. Strictly an upgrade from `Manual`
  — the "cannot attribute this" value — to a source recorded against that
  checksum: it cannot overwrite an attribution already made, and cannot
  invent one, because the artifact table is content-addressed and a matching
  row describes literally these bytes.

  1.1.3's tests only exercised a fresh install against an empty database,
  which is why they passed while the actual upgrade path did not. Caught by
  installing from the catalog on a real server and watching the badge fail
  to change.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Every plugin was labelled "Manual", whatever its actual origin** —
  including one CraftKeeper had just downloaded from the catalog, checksum-
  verified, and installed itself.

  `App\Plugins\PluginInventoryService` attributes a file on disk to a known
  source by looking it up in `plugin_artifacts` by checksum. **Nothing ever
  wrote to that table** — it was read in two places and written in none — so
  the lookup always missed and every installation fell back to `Manual`. The
  `Catalog` / `Hangar` / `Modrinth` states of `ProvenanceBadge` were
  unreachable in practice: the display half was built, the recording half was
  not (`App\Models\PluginArtifact`'s own docblock says "the record Task 14/15
  populate", which never happened).

  The install now records the artifact — checksum, size, source, version —
  at the moment the bytes land. The source is not inferred: the operation
  plan already captured it at propose time from the resolved catalog release,
  and that exact value is persisted.

  Written **after** the atomic write, so a row can never claim an origin for
  a file that was never installed, and as an upsert, since `sha256` is unique
  and the same bytes can legitimately be installed more than once. Recording
  is best-effort: an install that has already succeeded on disk is never
  failed over a label.

  Found by installing a plugin from the new catalog end to end and looking at
  the result, not by reading code.

**Not affected, contrary to an earlier guess:** plugin updates. Those resolve
their download from the source in the request, not from stored provenance, so
a wrong label never misdirected an update. The defect was traceability — the
badge could not distinguish a jar CraftKeeper fetched from a signed catalog
from one someone dropped in by hand, which is the only question it exists to
answer.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Server version detection failed on ordinary Paper servers, including
  the deployment CraftKeeper primarily targets.** Both existing strategies
  break on [Legendary Java Minecraft (Geyser + Floodgate)][legendary]:

  - the server JAR is `paperclip.jar` — the bootstrap's generic name,
    carrying no version to parse; and
  - the startup banner only lives in `logs/latest.log` until that file
    **rotates**, after which there is nothing left to read.

  So the version resolved on a freshly-booted server and silently became
  "Version unknown" a day later. Found while verifying the 1.1.1 shell fix
  against a real server: the same detector answered `Paper 26.1.2` in the
  morning and `unknown` that evening, with nothing having changed but the
  log rotating.

  A third source is now consulted when the first two find nothing:
  `version_history.json`, which the Paperclip bootstrap (Paper, Purpur,
  Folia) writes at the Minecraft root and updates on every boot. It is
  durable across log rotation and is the server's own record rather than a
  filename convention being inferred from.

  Its label is used **verbatim** — e.g. `1.21.4-130-abcdef1 (MC: 1.21.4)`
  rather than a tidied "Paper 1.21.4". The file does not say which
  distribution wrote it (Paper, Purpur and Folia all use Paperclip), so
  prefixing a brand would be inventing one. Same rule the log banner
  already follows: a self-report is passed through, a convention is parsed.

  Consulted **last**, so no install that already resolves a version gets a
  different answer — only the previously-unavailable case gains one. Read
  bounded and validated (non-object JSON, a missing or non-string key, an
  empty value, or an absurdly long one all yield "unknown" rather than
  putting junk on screen). Verified against a real server's actual file,
  not only a synthetic fixture.

- The Server page described every version as discovered from either "a
  server JAR filename" or "the startup log" via a two-branch ternary, so a
  third source would have been mislabelled as the log.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-22

The application shell was displaying invented server and account data on
every page of every install. It also fixes the release scan gate, which has
now withheld `:latest` for three consecutive releases.

### Fixed

- **The sidebar reported a server that does not exist.** Every page showed a
  server called "Survival" at "mc.example.net" running "Paper 1.21.4", with
  a green Online indicator and "3 / 40 online" — on an install where nobody
  had ever logged in, against a server whose `max-players` is 20.

  `resources/js/layouts/AppShell.tsx` carried those as component defaults,
  left over from the design-system mock it was built against, and not one of
  its 25 call sites ever passed a real value. Nothing was wired; the
  placeholder simply *was* the product. Real values now arrive as an Inertia
  shared prop, so no page can render the shell without them, and every field
  is nullable with null meaning **unknown**:

  - The player count shows "Players unknown" when RCON is unavailable —
    never a fabricated 0, matching the guarantee `App\Server\RconStatus`
    already made and this component was quietly breaking.
  - Status is `unknown`, not `online`, when RCON cannot be reached:
    CraftKeeper cannot distinguish "the server is down" from "I cannot reach
    it", so it claims neither. The indicator dot follows the real state
    instead of being painted green unconditionally.
  - `max-players` is read from `server.properties`. When that is unreadable
    the online count is shown alone rather than against an invented
    denominator — Minecraft's own default of 20 would be indistinguishable
    to an operator from a value actually read from their file.
  - The address line is gone. CraftKeeper manages a filesystem and an RCON
    port; it has no way to know the hostname players connect on.

- **The account menu claimed two-factor authentication was enabled**
  whether or not it was. This is the same bug as above and the reason it is
  worth its own entry: an operator checking whether they had set up TOTP was
  told "TOTP on" by a hard-coded placeholder. It now reflects the account.

- **The account menu could not sign you out.** It offered a permanently
  disabled item reading "Sign out (available once sign-in ships)" — written
  before authentication existed and never revisited, so the shell's own menu
  had no way out long after sign-in shipped in 1.0.0.

- **The release vulnerability gate, on the third attempt.** 1.0.1 fixed how
  the ignore file was loaded; 1.1.0 fixed the loader and still failed,
  because the file enumerated four specific `linux-libc-dev` CVE IDs and
  Debian had since published a batch of new ones — seven of them HIGH,
  against the same package and the same version. An enumerated list of
  kernel CVEs is stale the moment Debian publishes again.

  Replaced with a Rego policy keyed on the package name (`.trivyignore.rego`),
  which cannot go stale that way. Kernel headers ship in the upstream
  `php:8.4-fpm-bookworm` base image and a container does not run its own
  kernel, so these are structurally inapplicable. Everything else still
  blocks: a CRITICAL/HIGH with a fix available in any other package fails the
  job and withholds the moving tags.

  Verified against the real published v1.1.0 image before committing — the
  exact command CI runs, and through the environment variable CI actually
  uses rather than the equivalent CLI flag: exit 1 without the policy, exit 0
  with it. Both earlier attempts shipped broken because the mechanism was
  read and assumed rather than run.

### Security

- `guzzlehttp/guzzle` 7.15.0 → 7.15.1, clearing three MEDIUM advisories
  (GHSA-f283-ghqc-fg79, GHSA-h95v-h523-3mw8, GHSA-wm3w-8rrp-j577).

### Added

- Tests pinning all of the above, each verified by mutation rather than
  assumed: the shared prop's honesty (`tests/Feature/ApplicationShellPropTest.php`),
  and — because the placeholder lived in the compiled JS bundle where no
  server-side assertion could ever see it, which is precisely why every
  suite stayed green while every install displayed it — the rendered shell
  and a working sign-out in `tests/e2e/server-operations.spec.ts`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-21

Realtime streaming now works in the published image — it previously could
not, however the container was configured. Alongside that: the panel a user
actually lands on after logging in, automatic adaptation to the Minecraft
volume's ownership, Host-header trust, and lighter password rules.

**Correction to 1.0.1's own notes below**, which claimed it restored the
moving tags: it did not. Its vulnerability scan failed — `.trivyignore.yaml`
was passed through the Trivy action's `trivyignores` input, which builds a
*plain-text* ignorefile, so every YAML entry was silently discarded and the
gate tripped on CVEs that were meant to be ignored. `publish-moving-tags` is
gated behind that scan, so `:latest`, `:v1`, and `:v1.0` were withheld for a
second consecutive release. Fixed here via `TRIVY_IGNOREFILE`; this is the
first release expected to publish them.

### Added

- **Live console and operation-progress streaming in the published image.**
  Enabling it is `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` plus the three `REVERB_APP_*`
  credentials — nothing else, and nothing to rebuild.

  Deliberately NOT done with Docker build args, which cannot work for a
  *published* image: `VITE_*` is inlined at build time, so the image would
  carry whatever key the CI runner happened to build with. The app key is
  published at runtime instead, as a `<meta>` tag from the Inertia root view.
  It is not a secret — it identifies a websocket client exactly as a Pusher
  app key does. `REVERB_APP_SECRET` never reaches the browser, and a test
  asserts that.

  The browser connects to the page's own origin rather than `REVERB_HOST`/
  `REVERB_PORT`, because Nginx already proxies the Pusher protocol's `/app`
  path through to Reverb — so the endpoint follows whatever port or reverse-
  proxy hostname you publish on. Build-time `VITE_REVERB_*` still wins when
  present, leaving `npm run dev` untouched.

- **CraftKeeper adapts to the Minecraft volume's ownership by itself.**
  Running it beside [Legendary Java Minecraft (Geyser + Floodgate)][legendary]
  no longer needs a hand-written `group_add` or a `chmod` on the shared
  volume: the entrypoint reads the volume's owning group at startup, joins
  it, ensures the directories it must write are group-writable, and then
  drops to its unprivileged user. The server image picks its own uid/gid at
  install time, so this can only be resolved at runtime.

- An end-to-end Playwright test for operation-progress streaming, running
  against a real Reverb server. The transition is driven from a second page,
  because approving from the watched page is a full Inertia visit that would
  re-render the panel from the response — that assertion would pass with the
  socket unplugged.

### Fixed

- **Every realtime page served a blank screen.** Assistant, the Console, and
  anything rendering operation progress returned HTTP 200 with an empty body.
  The image builds with no `.env`, so every `VITE_REVERB_*` was undefined in
  the published bundle; Echo handed that undefined key to Pusher, whose
  constructor throws synchronously during render. Every suite passed because
  they all run against `artisan serve` with a real `.env` — the one
  environment nobody exercised is the one that ships. With no key built in,
  Echo now gets its own `null` broadcaster and each page renders its designed
  degraded state.

- **Broadcasts failed with `Unable to parse URI: https://:443`.**
  `REVERB_HOST` was unset in the image and Laravel defaults to no host, port
  443, https. The socket connected and the channel authorised, then nothing
  was ever delivered — a failure that reads exactly like a client bug. The
  Dockerfile now defaults `REVERB_HOST`/`PORT`/`SCHEME` to the internal
  publish hop Supervisor actually binds.

- **Any client-supplied `Host` header was reflected into generated absolute
  URLs**, so a poisoned Host could mail a victim a correctly-signed, working
  password-reset link pointing at an attacker's domain. Trust is now limited
  to `APP_URL`'s host, the new `TRUSTED_HOSTS`, and the loopback literals.

- **Logging in landed on the starter kit's dashboard**, and all eight
  settings pages rendered in the starter kit's chrome — a different sidebar,
  a generic heading, and a second nav list stacked under CraftKeeper's own.

- The Content-Security-Policy advertised a websocket origin even when
  broadcasting was disabled. Both websocket origins are now gated on Reverb
  actually being the active broadcaster.

### Changed

- **Password rules for the single admin account are length-and-breach only**
  (`min(10)->uncompromised()`), replacing 12 characters plus mixed case,
  numbers and symbols. Not a straight weakening: NIST SP 800-63B advises
  against composition rules, which push people toward predictable shapes
  while adding little entropy. The breach check sends only the first five
  characters of the password's SHA-1 (k-anonymity) and fails open when
  unreachable, so air-gapped installs still work.

- `compose.example.yml` and `compose.legendary.yml` document enabling
  realtime, and no longer carry the manual `group_add`/`chmod` steps that the
  entrypoint now handles.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-18

Repairs to the container image and the release pipeline, both of which ran
end-to-end against a real tag for the first time in 1.0.0. No application
behaviour changes.

The 1.0.0 image is functional, but 1.0.0 published no moving tags: its
release pipeline's smoke test, vulnerability scan, and signing job all
failed, and `publish-moving-tags` is deliberately gated behind them, so
`:latest`, `:v1`, and `:v1.0` were never created. This release restores them.

### Fixed

- **The application could not boot without a `.env` file.**
  `config/broadcasting.php` fell back to the `reverb` driver while
  `routes/channels.php` calls `Broadcast::channel()` during boot, so with no
  `REVERB_*` credentials the driver constructed Pusher with a null auth key
  and threw before the framework finished starting. This was not a loss of
  streaming — the application failed to start at all, and it took down
  `composer install` with it (its post-autoload-dump hook runs
  `artisan package:discover`). The fallback is now `log`; realtime streaming
  is opt-in via `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` plus credentials.

- **The container returned 503 on every request unless `DATA_ROOT` or
  `DB_DATABASE` was set.** `docker/entrypoint.sh` assigned both without
  `export`, so PHP never saw them: the entrypoint prepared and migrated
  `/data/database.sqlite` while the application read
  `storage/craftkeeper/database.sqlite`. Both are now exported, making the
  entrypoint's defaults authoritative.

- **SBOM generation failed the signing job.** `anchore/sbom-action` attempted
  to attach SBOMs to the GitHub Release, which requires `contents: write` —
  a permission the signing job intentionally does not hold. SBOMs are still
  published as workflow artifacts and attested to the image with `cosign`.

- **The vulnerability gate could never pass.** The scan blocked on 209
  CRITICAL/HIGH findings, 128 of them from `linux-libc-dev` — Linux kernel
  CVEs attributed to a headers package, for a kernel no container runs. It
  now reports only vulnerabilities with an available fix, which is an
  actionable signal; the few remaining kernel-header CVEs are listed with
  expiry dates in `.trivyignore.yaml`. The gate remains blocking, and full
  results at every severity are still uploaded to the Security tab.

- CI's Frontend job typechecked against Wayfinder-generated modules it never
  generated, and `image.yml` interpolated a build output directly into a shell
  command (flagged by zizmor).

### Changed

- `compose.example.yml` and `compose.legendary.yml` pin an explicit image tag
  instead of `:latest`, so a documented quickstart cannot break when moving
  tags are withheld by a release gate.

### Added

- Documentation and a compose file for running CraftKeeper alongside
  [Legendary Java Minecraft (Geyser + Floodgate)][legendary], the primary
  supported deployment. Two mismatches between the images are documented with
  verified fixes: a UID difference that makes every write fail while reads
  succeed, and a `755` volume root that breaks atomic writes to
  `server.properties` specifically.

- CI now boots the built image twice — once with only the environment
  `compose.example.yml` documents, and once with nothing but `APP_KEY` — and
  requires `/up` to return 200. Both bugs above were invisible to the existing
  suites because every test harness supplied configuration that real
  invocations do not.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-18

The first stable release of CraftKeeper: an AGPL-3.0-or-later,
Docker-native control plane for a single Minecraft server, built as one
Laravel 13 + Inertia 3 / React 19 application with SQLite persistence.

### Added

- **Deployment.** A single multi-stage Docker image (PHP 8.4-FPM, Nginx,
  Supervisor, a non-root `craftkeeper` user) exposing HTTP on `:8080`,
  designed for Docker Compose behind Dokploy HTTPS. Never requires Docker
  socket access. `GET /up` reports application and database readiness.
- **Onboarding and authentication.** First-run setup creates exactly one
  administrator (registration disables itself afterward), with optional
  TOTP two-factor and recovery codes. Local username/password only — no
  external identity provider in V1.
- **Contained Minecraft filesystem.** Every read/write is canonically
  resolved beneath the mounted `/minecraft` directory, rejects path
  traversal, NUL bytes, and symlinks that escape the root, and only
  operates on regular files. Config discovery recognizes Server, Paper,
  Geyser/Floodgate, and plugin configuration across `.properties`,
  YAML, JSON, and TOML.
- **Guided, structured, and source config editing** that converge on one
  reviewable diff: validated, snapshotted, atomically written, and
  audited. Concurrent external edits produce a conflict for resolution,
  never a silent overwrite. Every edit is restorable from its revision
  history.
- **RCON control and server operations.** A bounded, timeout-protected
  Minecraft Source RCON client; a command policy separating safe
  predefined actions from elevated commands requiring fresh approval;
  graceful stop (`save-all flush` then `stop`); live console, player
  activity, and log tailing with realtime updates over Reverb.
- **Plugin lifecycle.** Discovery from the CraftKeeper Catalog, Hangar,
  and Modrinth, plus manual JAR upload — each verified by hash, parsed
  for metadata, staged in quarantine, and installed/updated/disabled/
  removed/rolled back with restart-required state tracked explicitly.
  The three catalog sources degrade independently of each other and of
  core operation.
- **Optional AI assistant.** Ollama and OpenAI-compatible providers,
  entirely optional and degrading cleanly when unavailable. Hosted AI
  requests have every known secret redacted before transmission, with
  the redaction disclosed to the operator. The AI may only propose
  configuration changes and safe RCON commands (plugin operations are an
  MCP-only proposal type, see below) — a human approves every mutation.
- **Versioned REST API (`/api/v1`).** Scoped personal-access tokens,
  idempotency-key support, cursor pagination, and a published
  `openapi.yaml` contract that is tested against the live route table.
- **MCP server.** OAuth 2.1 (authorization code + mandatory PKCE),
  per-grant scope ceilings independent of the live token's own claims,
  and a closed, three-tool surface (propose config change, propose
  plugin operation, run a safe RCON command) — no MCP tool can approve
  its own or any other proposal.
- **Settings, integrations, backups, and diagnostics.** A consolidated
  Integrations overview and Settings area; on-demand application-state
  backups (SQLite `VACUUM INTO`, checksummed, restorable only into a
  fresh `/data`); a secret-free support bundle for troubleshooting;
  optional Umami analytics, disabled by default and incapable of
  blocking any request path.
- **Design system and accessibility.** A shared `AppShell`, responsive
  down to 390px (tables become cards, split panes become bottom sheets
  below 768px), six themes (dark default; light, terracotta, emerald,
  slate, bronze), WCAG 2.2 AA contrast verified by computed-style
  end-to-end tests, keyboard traversal, and reduced-motion support.
- **CI/CD.** Separate PHP/frontend/browser/integration/container CI
  jobs; a signed, multi-architecture (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`)
  release image with SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs, build provenance, and
  keyless Sigstore/Cosign signing, published as `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:X`,
  and `:latest` (the last withheld from prerelease tags) on every signed
  `v*` tag.

### Security

- Per-request nonce'd Content-Security-Policy, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and conditional
  `Strict-Transport-Security` on every response.
- Structural filesystem containment, RCON bounds, and secret redaction
  verified end-to-end (not only unit-level) in
  `tests/Integration/Security/`.
- All mutations pass through one audited `Operation` lifecycle; MCP and
  API principals are structurally incapable of self-approving a
  proposal they created (see `docs/security/threat-model.md`).

### Known limitations

Disclosed here rather than left implicit — see
`docs/operations/v1-acceptance.md` and `docs/security/threat-model.md`
for the full detail behind each:

- Secret redaction is **value-based**: only secrets CraftKeeper already
  knows about (stored `Secret` rows and schema-flagged config fields)
  are scrubbed from outgoing AI requests, logs, and audit metadata. A
  credential that has never been entered into CraftKeeper cannot be
  redacted, because CraftKeeper has no way to recognize it as one.
- Log tailing has a narrow race window across file rotation/truncation
  where a handful of lines can be skipped rather than double-read; see
  `App\Server\LogTailService`'s own inode/offset-tracking docblock.
- Minecraft's own console output is broadcast to the admin-only realtime
  channel **verbatim** — it is not secret-redacted, since it is
  free-form third-party stdout CraftKeeper does not control the shape
  of (a deliberate, documented boundary, not an oversight).
- Plugin install and update are exposed through the web UI only — not
  yet part of `/api/v1` or the MCP tool surface (disable/remove are).
- There is no self-service, web-based backup **restore** — restoring
  means placing a downloaded archive's `database.sqlite` into a fresh
  `/data` and restarting the container (see
  `docs/operations/recovery.md`).
- The Playwright end-to-end suite runs Chromium only; Firefox/WebKit
  projects are a one-line config addition once run in an environment
  with registry access to fetch those browser binaries.
- The four accent themes (terracotta/emerald/slate/bronze) are
  implemented and manually reachable via the design-system page, but do
  not yet have dedicated per-accent automated axe/contrast coverage.
- The AI provider adapter does not yet distinguish a 401, a 429, and a
  timeout into separate reported states — all three currently collapse
  to the same generic "unavailable" signal.
- Hangar and Modrinth response-shape handling is verified against
  recorded fixtures, not against a live call to either service made as
  part of this repository's own test/CI runs.
- `/api/v1`'s cursor pagination is bounded: `OperationController::index()`
  and `ConfigController::listProposals()` materialize at most the most
  recent 1000 rows before paginating in memory. Past that ceiling,
  `has_more: false` is indistinguishable from genuine end-of-data — a
  silent cap this project's own principles would otherwise flag, so it is
  disclosed here explicitly rather than left implicit.
