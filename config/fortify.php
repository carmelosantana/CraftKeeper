    | CraftKeeper V1 is a single-admin, self-hosted app with no mail server
    | (see docs/architecture/decisions.md, Task 4):
    |
    |  - `registration` is disabled. Public self-registration would allow a
    |    second admin; the only way to create the (single) admin account is
    |    the first-run onboarding wizard at `/onboarding`, which is gated on
    |    installation state, not on this feature.
    |  - `emailVerification` is disabled. A self-hosted single admin has no
    |    mail server to receive a verification link on, so requiring one
    |    would permanently lock them out of their own install.
    |  - `passkeys` is disabled. Not part of the V1 auth surface (local
    |    username/password + optional TOTP); leaving it enabled with no
    |    onboarding path to register a passkey would just be a dead,
    |    unreachable feature.
